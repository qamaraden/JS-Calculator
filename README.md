### HOMEWORK OUTLINE
The goal was to create a command line calculator application that has two settings, (b)asic and (a)dvanced. The basic setting has 4 options:
* addition
* subtraction
* multiplication
* division
The advanced setting has 2 options; square root and power.
After completing the goal, I had the option to do a bonus task which was to include a BMI calculator in two settings:
 * Metric
 * Imperial
After completing the bonus task, I had the option to also do a super bonus task and the aim of the task was the following:
 *"Add the following calculator feature into your app.

   Trip Calculator

   This feature asks the user for four inputs; distance, fuel efficiency (mpg), cost per gallon, speed and it will give you      the time and price of your journey."
There was a note that stated "for every 1 MPH over 60 MPH, reduce the the MPG by 2 MPG"
